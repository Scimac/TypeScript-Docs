### Arrays

- Arrays in TypeScript can be declared with a specific type or as a union of types using square brackets `[]` or `Array<type>` which mean the same thing.

```typescript
// Specific type of data in an array
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let names: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

// Union arrays -- allowing elements of different types within the same array
let mixedArray: (string | number)[] = ["Alice", 30, "Bob", 25];

// generics arrays -- allowing arrays of any type using a type parameter.
let genericArray: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

- Nested arrays have brackets added based on the levels of nesting.

```typescript
let nestedArray: number[][] = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
```

- Array methods works normally. Only thing to mind is the types when setting the returned value to any variable.

```typescript
// Declared Array
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Find index of element
let index: number = numbers.indexOf(3); 

// Find first element greater than 3
let foundNumber: number | undefined = numbers.find(num => num > 3); 

// Filter even numbers
let filteredNumbers: number[] = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); 


numbers.push(6); // Add element to end of array
let lastElement: number = numbers.pop(); // Remove last element
numbers.splice(2, 1); // Remove element at index 2

// Iterate through array elements
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num));

// Map array elements
let squaredNumbers: number[] = numbers.map(num => num * num); 

// Destructuring
let [first, second, ...nums] = [...numbers];
```

#### Readonly Arrays

- Readonly arrays are arrays whose elements cannot be modified after initialization. 
- This provides immutability and ensures that the array remains unchanged throughout its lifecycle.

```typescript
// Add readonly keyword before the type
let readonlyArray: readonly number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```


### Tuples

- Tuples in TypeScript allows to express an array with a **fixed number of elements**, where each element has a **specific type**. 
- Unlike arrays, tuples enable you to define a strict sequence of different types within a single data structure.

- A tuple in TypeScript is defined by specifying the types of its elements within square brackets `[]`. Each type is separated by a comma `,`.

```typescript
// Array Definition
let arrayName: Type[] = [value1, value2, ..., valueN];

// Tuple Definition
let tupleName: [Type1, Type2, ..., TypeN] = [value1, value2, ..., valueN];
```

- Tuples are useful for representing fixed-length collections of heterogeneous data, where the order of elements is significant.

```typescript
let coordinates: [number, number] = [10, 20];

let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];

let name: string = person[0]; 
let age: number = person[1];

// Destructuring 
let [name, age] = person;
```

#### Variable Length Tuples

- We can use optional and rest elements in tuples to make certain elements optional or to allow variable-length tuples.

```typescript
// Optional element
let data: [string, number?] = ["Alice"];

// Rest element
let numbers: [string, ...number[]] = ["Alice", 1, 2, 3];
```

#### Readonly Tuples 

- Readonly tuples in TypeScript are tuples whose elements cannot be modified after initialization. This ensures that the tuple remains immutable throughout its lifecycle.

```typescript
let readonlyTuple: readonly [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
```

#### Named Tuples

- Named tuples in TypeScript allow us to assign names to individual elements within a tuple. This enhances code readability and provides self-documentation.

```typescript
let person: [name: string, age: number] = ["Alice", 30];
let name: string = person.name; // Accessing named element
```

#### More on tuples

- Tuples can be used as function return types to enforce strict return structures.
- TypeScript allows destructuring of tuples for concise assignment of individual elements.
- Tuples support optional and rest elements, enabling flexibility in tuple definitions.
- Named tuples provide semantic meaning to tuple elements, improving code readability.
- `useState` in react returns a tuple of the value and a setter function. `const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('User 1')`.

### Enums

- Enums in TypeScript provide a way to define a set of named constants, making it easier to work with sets of related values. 
- Enums in TypeScript are defined using the `enum` keyword followed by the name of the enum and a set of named constants enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- By default, the enums will initialize/mapped the first value to `0` and increment by 1 for each additional value.

```typescript
enum Direction {
    North,  // Assigned value: 0
    South,  // Assigned value: 1
    East,  // Assigned value: 2
    West  // Assigned value: 3
}
```

- In this example, `Direction` is the name of the enum, and `North`, `South`, `East`, and `West` are the named constants or enum members.
- `Direction[North] === 0` and `Direction[1] === South`.
####  Enum Values

- By default, enum members are assigned numeric values starting from 0. However, we can explicitly assign custom values to enum members.

```typescript
enum Direction {
    North,    // Assigned value: 0
    South = 6,
    East,     // Assigned value: 7
    West      // Assigned value: 8
}
```

- In this example, `South` is explicitly assigned a value of 1, and subsequent enum members are automatically assigned incremental values.
- Enum values can be **accessed using dot notation `.` or by directly using enum member names**.

```typescript
let direction: Direction = Direction.North;
console.log(direction); // Output: 0

console.log(Direction.South); // Output: 1
```

#### Computed Enum Members

- Computed enum members in TypeScript allow you to assign values to enum constants dynamically using expressions or function calls.

```typescript
enum Direction {
    North = 1,
    South = North * 2,
    East = getEastDirection(),
    West = 10
}

function getEastDirection() {
    return Direction.North + Direction.South;
}
```

#### Reverse/bi-directional Mapping

- Enums in TypeScript support reverse mapping, allowing you to retrieve enum member names from their values.

```typescript
enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West
}

let directionName: string = Direction[1]; // Retrieves "South" from value 1
console.log(directionName); // Output: "South"

console.log(Direction)
// enum struct 
// {
//     '0': 'North',
//     '1': 'South',
//     '2': 'East',
//     '3': 'West',
//     North: 0,
//     South: 1,
//     East: 2,
//     West: 3
// }
```
#### Heterogeneous Enums

- Enums in TypeScript can contain both numeric and string values. This is called heterogeneous enums.
- But if string is assigned to any one member, all the subsequent members should ahve values assigned to them - string or number. 

```typescript
enum Status {
    Success = 200,
    NotFound = "404"
}
```
#### Const Enums

- Const enums in TypeScript are enums that are removed from the generated JavaScript code during compilation, resulting in zero runtime impact.
- JS code for the corresponding `const enum` will not be generated!!

```typescript
const enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West
}

console.log(Direction);
// The above line will spawn the following error -- 
// 'const' enums can only be used in property or index access expressions or the right hand side of an import declaration or export assignment or type query.

// const Enums can be only used like
console.log(Direction.North);

// Even this will throw an error
console.log(Direction[2]);
```
#### Ambient Enums 

- Ambient enums in TypeScript are enums defined in external declarations, usually in `.d.ts` files. 
- They are used to describe the shape of existing enum types.
- Ambient enums are useful for working with third-party libraries or APIs that define their own enums.

```typescript
declare enum HTTPStatus {
    OK = 200,
    NotFound = 404,
    InternalServerError = 500
}
```

#### Enum Member Merging

- Enum member merging in TypeScript allows to extend existing enums with additional members in separate enum declarations.

```typescript
enum Fruit {
    Apple,
    Banana
}

enum Fruit {
    Orange = 2,
    Mango
}

console.log(Fruit.Apple); // Output: 0
console.log(Fruit.Banana); // Output: 1
console.log(Fruit.Orange); // Output: 2
console.log(Fruit.Mango); // Output: 3

//'Fruit.Orange' is added to the 'Fruit' enum in a separate declaration, extending the original enum with new members.
```

#### Union Enums

- Union enums in TypeScript allows to combine multiple enum types into a single type using the union (`|`) operator.
- Union enums enables to create flexible types that can represent values from multiple enum types.

```typescript
enum DayOfWeek {
    Sunday,
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday
}

enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}

type DayOrColor = DayOfWeek | Color;

let value: DayOrColor = DayOfWeek.Monday;
console.log(value); // Output: 1

value = Color.Blue;
console.log(value); // Output: 2
```
#### Objects vs Enums

- In modern TypeScript, we may not need an enum when an object with `as const` could suffice.
- Enums exist at compile time but are real objects that also exist at runtime. 
- However, `keyof` works differently for enums compared to typical objects. Instead, you should use `keyof typeof` to get a type that represents all enum keys as strings.

```typescript
enum LogLevel {
  ERROR,
  WARN,
  INFO,
  DEBUG,
}
 
/**
 * This is equivalent to:
 * type LogLevelStrings = 'ERROR' | 'WARN' | 'INFO' | 'DEBUG';
 */
type LogLevelStrings = keyof typeof LogLevel;
 
function printImportant(key: LogLevelStrings, message: string) {
  const num = LogLevel[key];
  if (num <= LogLevel.WARN) {
    console.log("Log level key is:", key);
    console.log("Log level value is:", num);
    console.log("Log level message is:", message);
  }
}
printImportant("ERROR", "This is a message");
```

- Using object as const, to replace enums

```typescript
const enum EDirection {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
 
const ODirection = {
  Up: 0,
  Down: 1,
  Left: 2,
  Right: 3,
} as const;
 
EDirection.Up;
           
(enum member) EDirection.Up = 0
 
ODirection.Up;
           
(property) Up: 0
 
// Using the enum as a parameter
function walk(dir: EDirection) {}
 
// It requires an extra line to pull out the values
type Direction = typeof ODirection[keyof typeof ODirection];
function run(dir: Direction) {}
 
walk(EDirection.Left);
run(ODirection.Right);
```
