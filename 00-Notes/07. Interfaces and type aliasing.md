### Type aliasing

- Type aliases allow creating custom names for types, making code more readable and maintainable.
- This can be done for simple types like `string`, `number` or complex types like `arrays`, `objects`.

```typescript
type graphName = string;
type count = number;

type Point = {
    x: count;
    y: count;
};

let p: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
```
#### Type Assertion

Type assertion is a way to tell the compiler about the type of a variable when TS can't infer it.
```typescript
let userInput: unknown;  
let strLength: number = (userInput as string).length;
```

- In the above example, `userInput` is of type `unknown`, so type assertion is used to treat it as a `string`.
#### Literal Types

- Literal types allow specifying exact values a variable can have.
```typescript
let status: "success" | "error";  
status = "success"; // Valid 
status = "pending"; // Error: 
//Type '"pending"' is not assignable to type '"success" | "error"'.`
```

- Here, `status` variable can only have the values `"success"` or `"error"`.

#### Type Narrowing 

- Type narrowing allows refining the type of a variable within a conditional block based on runtime checks. 
- It enables writing more precise and type-safe code by eliminating unreachable code paths.

```typescript
type Animal = Cat | Dog;

function makeSound(animal: Animal) {
    if ("meow" in animal) {
        console.log(animal.meow); // Type narrowed to Cat
    } else {
        console.log(animal.bark); // Type narrowed to Dog
    }
}
```

- The `unknown` type requires type assertion or type narrowing to access its value safely.

```typescript 
let userInput: unknown; 

// Type assertion or type narrowing is required to access the value safely 
userInput = prompt("Enter a value:"); 

if (typeof userInput === "string") { 
	console.log(userInput.toUpperCase()); // Safe access after type narrowing 
} else { 
	console.log("Invalid input."); 
} 
```
### Interfaces

- Interfaces are similar to type aliases, except they **only** apply to `object` types.
- Interfaces in TypeScript provide a way to define contracts for object shapes. 
- They define the structure of objects by specifying the types of their properties and methods.

```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface Greeter {
	greet(): void
}

function greet(person: Person): void {
    console.log(`Hello, ${person.name}! You are ${person.age} years old.`);
}

let user: Person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30
};

greet(user);
```

### Interface extends

- Interfaces can extend each other's definition.
- **Extending** an interface means you are creating a new interface with the same properties as the original, plus something new.

```typescript
interface Rectangle {  
  height: number,  
  width: number  
}  
  
interface ColoredRectangle extends Rectangle {  
  color: string  
}  
  
const coloredRectangle: ColoredRectangle = {  
  height: 20,  
  width: 10,  
  color: "red"  
};
```
#### Interface implements

- Objects can implement interfaces to ensure they adhere to the contract specified by the interface. 
- To implement an interface, use the `implements` keyword. Class can implement more than one interfaces at a time.

```typescript
// implements keyword use
class Student implements Person, Greeter {
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet(): void {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
}
```

### Differences between interfaces and type aliases

1. Definition

  - An interface in TypeScript is a syntactical contract that defines the structure of an object. It specifies properties, methods, and their types but does not provide an implementation.
  - A type alias, also known as a type synonym, allows developers to create a name for any type, including primitive types, unions, intersections, and more complex types.

  ```typescript
  interface Person {
      name: string;
      age: number;
  }

  type Person = {
      name: string;
      age: number;
  };
  ```

2. Usage

  - Interfaces are ideal for defining object blueprints or shapes that multiple classes or objects can implement.
  - Type aliases are versatile and can represent a wide range of types, not limited to objects. They can represent primitive types, unions, intersections, tuples, and more. and are often used to simplify complex type annotations or create reusable custom types.

  ```typescript
  //interfacing
  interface Person {
      name: string;
      age: number;
  }

  const user: Person = {
      name: "Alice",
      age: 30
  };

// type aliasing
  type Person = {
      name: string;
      age: number;
  };

  const user: Person = {
      name: "Alice",
      age: 30
  };
  ```

3. Extensibility

  - Interfaces support extending other interfaces, allowing for the creation of complex type hierarchies and inheritance relationships.
  - Type aliases do not inherently support extending other types. Instead, TypeScript provides the concept of intersections (`&`) to combine multiple types into one.

  ```typescript
  //interface
  interface Animal {
      name: string;
  }

  interface Dog extends Animal {
      breed: string;
  }

// type aliasing
  type Animal = {
      name: string;
  };

  type Dog = Animal & {
      breed: string;
  };
  ```

4. Augmentation

  - Interfaces support augmentation, meaning you can add new members to an existing interface in the same scope.
  - Unlike interfaces, type aliases cannot be augmented or extended once defined. They provide a single definition for a type, and modifications require redefining the alias.
  
  ```typescript
  // interfacing
  interface Window {
      title: string;
  }

  interface Window {
      ts: TypeScriptAPI;
  }

// type aliasing
  type Window = {
      title: string;
  };

  type Window = {
      ts: TypeScriptAPI;
  }; // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Window'.
  ```

### Type Casting

- TypeScript provides a powerful feature called type casting, which allows you to convert a variable from one type to another. 
- Type casting is useful when you need to inform the TypeScript compiler about the actual type of a value, especially when TypeScript cannot infer it automatically.

#### Type Assertion

- Type assertion is the most common way to perform type casting in TypeScript. 
- It's like a type conversion in other programming languages, but it doesn't actually change the runtime behavior of the code; it's purely for the benefit of the TypeScript compiler.

```typescript
let variableName: Type = <Type> value;

// or 

let variableName: Type = value as Type;
```

```typescript
let someValue: any = "Hello, TypeScript!";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
```

- Casting doesn't actually change the type of the data within the variable, for example the following code will not work as expected since the variable `x` is still holds a number.  

```typescript
let x: unknown = 4;  
console.log((x as string).length); // prints undefined
console.log((<string>x).length); // prints undefined
```

- TypeScript will still attempt to typecheck casts to prevent casts that don't seem correct. 

```typescript
console.log((4 as string).length); 

// Error: Conversion of type 'number' to type 'string' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
```

> The **Force casting** help in how to override this.
#### Forced Overriding

- Force casting, also known as type assertion or type casting, is a technique used to override type errors that TypeScript may throw when casting a variable from one type to another.

```typescript
let variableName: TargetType = originalValue as unknown as TargetType;

let inputValue: any = "42"; let numericValue: number = inputValue as unknown as number;
```

- In this example, `inputValue` is initially of type `any`, so TypeScript cannot infer its type. 
- By first casting it to `unknown`, you acknowledge that the type is uncertain. 
- Then, you cast it to `number` to explicitly specify the intended type. This allows TypeScript to accept the assignment without type errors.
#### Type Assertion vs. Type Coercion

- Type assertion should not be confused with type coercion. Type coercion is a runtime feature where JavaScript automatically converts types during operations. 
- On the other hand, type assertion is a compile-time feature used to inform TypeScript about the type of a value.

```typescript
let x: any = "123";

// Type coercion, JavaScript automatically converts 'x' to a number
let y: number = x; 

// Type assertion, informing TypeScript that 'x' is of type number
let z: number = x as number; 
```

#### Non-null Assertion Operator (`!`)

- The non-null assertion operator is used to assert that an expression is not null or undefined when TypeScript's strict null checks are enabled (`strictNullChecks`).

```typescript
identifier!: Type;
```

```typescript
let element: HTMLElement | null = document.getElementById("app");

// Asserting that 'element' is not null
element!.innerText = "Hello, TypeScript!"; 
```

In this example, `element!` asserts that `element` is not null, allowing you to access its properties without TypeScript complaining about null or undefined.

#### Type Casting with `as` Keyword

Type casting with the `as` keyword is similar to type assertion but is generally preferred in TypeScript.

```typescript
let value: any = "Hello, TypeScript!";
let strLength: number = (value as string).length;
```

Here, `(value as string)` casts `value` to a string type, enabling you to access its `length` property without type errors.
