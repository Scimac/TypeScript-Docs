### Type Inference

- Type inference in TypeScript allows the compiler to deduce the types of variables, parameters, and return values based on their usage within the code. 
- This reduces the need for explicit type annotations in many cases.

```typescript
let message = "Hello, TypeScript!"; // Type inference infers 'string' type
```
### Union and Intersection Types

Union and intersection types in TypeScript allow you to combine multiple types together, providing flexibility and expressiveness in your code.

```typescript
//Union of types
type NumberOrString = number | string;

// Intersection of types
type Employee = {
    name: string;
    id: number;
} & { department: string };
```
#### Union Types

Union types allow a variable to hold values of multiple types. It is denoted using the pipe (`|`) symbol.

```typescript
let age: number | string;  
age = 25;       // Valid 
age = "twenty"; // Valid 
age = true;     // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'number | string'.
```
- In the above example, the `age` variable can hold either a `number` or a `string` value.
#### Intersection Types

Intersection types combine multiple types into one. It is denoted using the ampersand (`&`) symbol.

```typescript
interface A {     
    propA: number; 
}  

interface B {     
    propB: string; 
}  

let obj: A & B = {     
    propA: 10,     
    propB: "Hello" 
};
```
- In the above example, `obj` must have properties from both interface `A` and interface `B`.
### Discriminated Unions

- Discriminated unions are a pattern used to work with objects that could be of multiple types but with a shared property that allows TypeScript to narrow down the possible types.

```typescript
interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}

interface Square {
    kind: "square";
    sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
    switch (shape.kind) {
        case "circle":
            return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
        case "square":
            return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    }
}
```
- Here, `kind` property is used to discriminate between different types of shapes in the `Shape` union.
### Mapped Types

Mapped types allow creating new types by transforming the properties of an existing type. They are particularly useful for creating new types based on existing ones with slight modifications.

```typescript
type Flags = {
    option1: boolean;
    option2: boolean;
};

type NullableFlags = {
    [K in keyof Flags]: boolean | null;
};

let flags: NullableFlags = { option1: true, option2: null };
```
### Conditional Types

Conditional types enable creating types that depend on other types. They allow defining complex conditional logic within type definitions, enabling more advanced type manipulation.

```typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;

let value: string | null = "Hello";
let nonNullValue: NonNullable<typeof value> = value; // Type of nonNullValue is 'string'
```
### Declaration Merging

Declaration merging allows extending the types defined in separate declarations into a single definition. It is useful for adding new members to interfaces, classes, or enums defined in external libraries.

```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
}

interface Person {
    age: number;
}

let person: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
```
### Module Augmentation

Module augmentation allows adding new declarations to existing modules from external libraries. It is useful for extending the functionality of third-party libraries without modifying their source code directly.

```typescript
// Declaration merging for third-party library
declare module "example-library" {
    interface Options {
        debug: boolean;
    }
}
```
### String Template Literal Types

String literal types allow specifying exact string values that a variable can hold. They enable creating types that only accept specific string literals, providing more precise type information.

```typescript
type Direction = "left" | "right" | "up" | "down";
let direction: Direction = "left"; // Valid
direction = "top"; // Error: 'top' is not assignable to type 'Direction'
```
### Tuple Types

Tuple types allow representing arrays with fixed lengths and specific element types at each position. They enable working with data structures where the order and type of elements are known and consistent.

```typescript
let tuple: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
let name: string = tuple[0];
let age: number = tuple[1];
```
### Type Guards

Type guards are expressions that narrow down the type of a variable within a conditional block. They enable writing code that behaves differently based on the type of the variable at runtime.

```typescript
function isString(value: any): value is string {
    return typeof value === "string";
}

function process(value: string | number) {
    if (isString(value)) {
        console.log(value.toUpperCase());
    } else {
        console.log(value.toFixed(2));
    }
}
```
### Enums

Enums allow defining a set of named constants, making it easier to work with related values. They enable creating more expressive and self-documenting code by giving meaningful names to numeric values.

```typescript
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

let color: Color = Color.Red;
console.log(color); // Output: 0
```
### Type Aliases for Union and Intersection Types

Type aliases can be used to define complex union and intersection types, improving code readability and maintainability.

```typescript
type ID = string | number;
type Callback = () => void;
type User = { name: string } & { age: number };
```
### Recursive Types

Recursive types allow defining types that reference themselves, enabling the creation of complex data structures such as trees and graphs.

```typescript
type TreeNode<T> = {
    value: T;
    children: TreeNode<T>[];
};

const node: TreeNode<number> = {
    value: 1,
    children: [
        { value: 2, children: [] },
        { value: 3, children: [{ value: 4, children: [] }] }
    ]
};
```
### Type Inference with Functions

Type inference in TypeScript extends to functions, allowing the compiler to deduce parameter types, return types, and contextual types based on usage and assignments.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b; // TypeScript infers return type as 'number'
}

const result = add(3, 4); // TypeScript infers result as 'number'
```
### Type Narrowing

Type narrowing allows refining the type of a variable within a conditional block based on runtime checks. It enables writing more precise and type-safe code by eliminating unreachable code paths.

```typescript
type Animal = Cat | Dog;

function makeSound(animal: Animal) {
    if ("meow" in animal) {
        console.log(animal.meow); // Type narrowed to Cat
    } else {
        console.log(animal.bark); // Type narrowed to Dog
    }
}
```
### Index Types and Index Signatures

Index types and index signatures allow defining dynamic property names for objects and working with property access in a type-safe manner.

```typescript
interface Dictionary<T> {
    [key: string]: T;
}

const colors: Dictionary<string> = {
    red: "#ff0000",
    green: "#00ff00",
    blue: "#0000ff"
};
```
### Type Guards with Classes

Type guards can also be implemented with classes using the `instanceof` operator to check the type of an object at runtime.

```typescript
class Shape {
    area() {
        return 0;
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    radius: number;

    constructor(radius: number) {
        super();
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    area() {
        return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
    }
}

function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
    if (shape instanceof Circle) {
        console.log("Area of circle:", shape.area());
    } else {
        console.log("Unsupported shape.");
    }
}
```
